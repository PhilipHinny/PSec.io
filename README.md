# PSec AI

## Overview
PSec AI is an AI-powered tool designed to generate reports based on a user's previously written reports. Unlike predefined templates, PSec AI learns from user-uploaded documents to create reports in a similar format, ensuring consistency and personalization.

## Features
- **Custom Report Generation**: Generates reports based on personal uploaded documents.
- **Format Adaptation**: Learns from the structure and style of user-submitted reports.
- **AI-Powered Learning**: Adapts to different writing styles and formatting preferences.
- **Secure & Private**: Ensures user data is processed securely with no third-party access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive workflow for uploading reports and generating new ones.

## How It Works
1. **Upload a Sample Report**: Users provide a previously written report to serve as a reference.
2. **AI Analysis**: PSec AI analyzes the structure, tone, and format of the uploaded document.
3. **Generate New Reports**: The AI produces new reports that follow the same format and writing style.
4. **Review & Edit**: Users can review the generated report and make necessary modifications.
